# This is the working-dev repository for the Revolt.fm page structure and design, codenamed »rotz«

This branch utilises SASS and HAML as metalanguages for CSS3 and HTML5 respectively. Not only to make fast-spaced development possible but above all to make code readable, reusable and structured.

Once this css-library/the mockup is stable it will be converted into a drupal template.
